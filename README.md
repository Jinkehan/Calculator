# StackCalc: A Stack-Based Arbitrary-Base Calculator

## Overview
StackCalc is a calculator application that represents natural numbers as lists of digits in arbitrary bases (from base-2 to base-36). Users can input numbers, perform arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication), and convert numbers between bases using a stack-based interface.

The project demonstrates functional programming techniques, list-based number representation, and recursive algorithms for arithmetic operations.

## Features
- **Arbitrary Base Support**: Perform calculations in any base from 2 to 36.
- **Stack-Based Computation**: Push, pop, and operate on numbers using a stack.
- **Addition & Multiplication**: Implements recursive digit-wise arithmetic.
- **Base Conversion**: Convert numbers between bases dynamically.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple stack-based calculator with intuitive operations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript
- **Logic & Algorithms**: Functional programming with recursive and loop-based arithmetic operations
- **Testing**: Unit tests for number operations
